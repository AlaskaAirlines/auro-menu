Installing as a direct, dev or peer dependency is up to the user installing the package.

### Design Token CSS Custom Property dependency

The use of any Auro custom element has a dependency on the [Auro Design Tokens](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens).

### CSS Custom Property fallbacks

[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) are [not supported](https://auro.alaskaair.com/support/custom-properties) in older browsers. For this, fallback properties are pre-generated and included with the npm.

Any update to the Auro Design Tokens will be immediately reflected with browsers that support CSS custom properties, legacy browsers will require updated components with pre-generated fallback properties.

### Define dependency in project component

Defining the component dependency within each component that is using the `<auro-menu>` component.

```javascript
import "@alaskaairuxauro-menu";
```

**Reference component in HTML**

```html
<auro-menu>Hello World</auro-menu>
```

## Install bundled assets from CDN

In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use.

**NOTE:** Be sure to replace `:version` in the URL with the version of the asset you want.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@alaskaairux/orion-design-tokens@:version/dist/tokens/CSSTokenProperties.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets@:version/dist/bundled/baseline.css" />

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@alaskaairuxauro-menu@:version/dist/polyfills.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@alaskaairuxauro-menu@:version/dist/auro-menu__bundled.js"></script>
```

### polyfills.js

The `polyfills.js` is packaged with this component, but **IT IS NOT NEEDED** to load a polyfill per component. The `polyfills.js` will work for all additional components added to the project.

### IE11 Support

**Displaimer:** While these components are supported in IE, there may be issues with loading the [web components polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills). Please consult their documentation when supporting IE11.
