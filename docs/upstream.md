# Maintaining your fork's upstream relationship

So you forked this repo. That's awesome. But don't forget you keep your `master` branch in sync with the upstream `master` branch to ensure that your pull requests will always be able to be merged.

## How to sync with upstream?

With a locally cloned repository, you can do this with git with your CLI as follows.

#### Add upstream

First you want to verify your current remote config settings.

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

This should return

```bash
origin  https://github.com/[yourUserName]/auro-menu.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/[yourUserName]/auro-menu.git (push)
```

To add the upstream repo to your local forked project

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro-menu.git
```

To validate this worked, run the following again

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

```
origin  https://github.com/[yourUserName]/auro-menu.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/[yourUserName]/auro-menu.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro-menu.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/auro-menu.git (push)
```

#### Sync upstream

To sync your master brach with your upstream master branch, there are two ways you can do this.

One way is to fetch and merge. This will work if your `master` branch shares the same history as the upstream brach sans merged updates since fork or last sync.

```bash
$ git checkout master

$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

#### Brute force

In the case where your `master` branch's history is not in sync with the upstream, then you have few options. The nuclear option is to trash the fork and re-fork, but there is an easier way. the following step will force reset your `master` branch with that of the upstream `master` branch.

```bash
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
```

Just to make sure that all things are synced correctly, run the following:

```bash
$ git checkout main

$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

## Maintain upstream

Once you have connected your local forked clone to the upstream repo, maintenance is the key. It is important to ensure that your `master` branch is always updated BEFORE you create a new branch intended to be used with a new pull request. This will help to eliminate any potential issues with merging when the `master` branches are out of sync.
