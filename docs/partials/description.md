The `<auro-menu>` element provides a list of options for a user to select from.

A list of options is created within the `<slot>` of the `<auro-menu>` element by using the `<auro-menuoption>` element to define options. Use a standard `<hr>` element to create dividers within the list of options.

The `<auro-menu>` element is designed for contextual menus, e.g. a dropdown menus. They are not intended to be used for navigation menus which have a different semantic meaning. The `<auro-menu>` element does not support hide/show functionality within its scope. This functionality will be managed by a wrapping element such as a drop-down menu composite element.
